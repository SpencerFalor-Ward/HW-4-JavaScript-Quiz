## Goal for the project
My goal for this project is to practice using JavaScript and jQuery to continue my journey towards **learning a true programing language** - *MATHS meets Language* 

We were given the following guidelines to complete a game that functions as such:
>Play proceeds as follows:

>The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View >Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

>Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately >begins countdown.

>Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a >time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

>When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. >Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.

>Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Benefits of this project
- **Practice JavaScritp and jQuery** alone and in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
- Thinking in JavaScript / jQuery
  - Variables, Objects, Functions 
  - :thinking::confounded::triumph:

## Hurddles 
The dificulties about this project are as follows:
- JavaScript and now jQuery- Full stop.
  - As always, adding my own personal touch with out getting to *deep in the weeds* particulary as far as styling goes. I think I did ok with that this assignment
- As always, staying focused!
  - *all my best distractions live in the same machine as this project*
